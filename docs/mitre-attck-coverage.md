# MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

## Overview

This page consolidates the MITRE ATT&CK techniques explicitly mapped within the individual investigations in this portfolio. Each technique links back to the investigation where it was identified, simulated, and analyzed.

## Future ATT&CK Expansion

The following tactics are not yet represented in this portfolio and are tracked in the [Roadmap](roadmap.md):

* **Lateral Movement** — planned Active Directory lab expansion
* **Privilege Escalation** — planned local/AD privilege escalation scenarios
* **Defense Evasion** — planned log tampering / detection evasion investigations
* **Command and Control** — planned C2 beacon detection exercise
* **Exfiltration** — planned data exfiltration detection scenario
* **Formal ATT&CK mapping for the Nmap and Nikto reconnaissance investigations** (currently documented narratively but without a dedicated mapping table)
