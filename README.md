## Introduction

I'm Uthman, a cybersecurity practitioner building toward a SOC Analyst / Detection Engineering role, with a focus on defensive security, log analysis, and incident investigation. This repository is a hands-on homelab portfolio documenting structured, end-to-end blue team work: attack simulations executed against a purpose-built lab, the telemetry they generate, and the SOC-style investigations performed to detect, analyze, and respond to that activity.

Every project here is built to mirror the workflows of a functioning SOC rather than a simple tutorial replication — each investigation moves from **simulated attacker activity → telemetry generation → detection → threat hunting → analyst assessment → MITRE ATT&CK mapping → defensive recommendations**, the same lifecycle used in production security operations.

**Certification:** CompTIA Security+

## Professional Overview

This portfolio demonstrates practical, demonstrable competence across the core SOC analyst skill set:

* Alert triage and log analysis
* SIEM investigation and threat hunting (Wazuh)
* Endpoint detection using Sysmon telemetry
* Network intrusion detection (Suricata)
* Web server log analysis (Apache)
* Authentication and credential-attack monitoring
* Attack simulation and detection validation
* MITRE ATT&CK-mapped incident reporting

The objective is straightforward: detections I've written, attacks I've simulated, incidents I've investigated, and tooling I can confidently explain in an interview setting.

---

## Architecture Overview

The lab is built on an isolated VirtualBox network combining an attacker workstation, a vulnerable web server, a monitored Windows endpoint, and a centralized Wazuh SIEM with Suricata IDS for network visibility.
